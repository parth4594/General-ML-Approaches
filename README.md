1. Unsupervised Learning using t-SNE:

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the   visualization of high-dimensional datasets. 
t-SNE differs from PCA by preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities whereas PCA is concerned with preserving large pairwise distances to maximize variance.
PCA is a linear dimension reduction technique that seeks to maximize variance and preserves large pairwise distances
